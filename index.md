# Prashant Singh Chouhan

### About me:

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Northeastern University. I am a part of the HPC lab led by Dr. Gene Cooperman. My research interests are in Computer Systems, Operating Systems, High-Performance Computing, and Computer System Security. Most of my time is spent on terminal hacking, debugging, and developing different systems software. Most of my research in the initial years has been based on finding applications of checkpointing in software fuzzing, and extending the idea of MPI-agnostic, Network-Agnostic (MANA) checkpointing to production-level HPC applications. I am looking to collaborate with people in academia and industry whose research interests align in similar areas.
